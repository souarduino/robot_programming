Abstract:
Potholes, a common consequence of neglected maintenance, pose a significant threat to road safety. 
To facilitate offline data collection for road repair, methods for identifying potholes on road surfaces focus on creating strategies for real-time or offline identification of these hazards. 
These factors have prompted an extensive global study into methods for identifying potholes on roadways. 
I demonstrate my contributions to this field using a mobile robot named Limo, built around the AgileX mobile platform. 
I implement methods for robot navigation and automatic pothole diagnosis using two techniques (OpenCV and YoloV8), showcasing the practical application of my proposed strategies.
